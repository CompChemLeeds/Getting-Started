# Getting-Started

This is a short introduction to how we want to use, store and share work in the group. The is document will mainly focus on setting up repositories on Github and your local workstation. There is also a seperate folder containing an introduction to Fortran95 (or newer!), Make files and python runscripts. Most of the information is general but some of it is specific to the group or using the [HPC](https://arcdocs.leeds.ac.uk/welcome.html) in Leeds.
